# This is Lupus590's Minecraft Instance
When testing Hive, this is what enviroment I will be using, if you are having issues then you may want to use this.

Other developers are encouraged to try variations and different enviroments, Hive needs to be adapatible. Remember to report your bugs.
If you want to track your enviromemt then create a branch and make your changes there. For ease of identifying which branch is who's, please name your branch after yourself.

Note: This is technicaly a mod pack, follow the licenses of the mods your are using.

Note: I have programming stuff in my resource pack folder (which is on the gitignore list), if code is broken because it's using something exernal then this is why. Please [yell at me](https://github.com/CC-Hive/DevEnviroment/issues/new). FYI, that resource pack is available [here](https://github.com/lupus590/CC-My-Code-Pack). _Why not use a submodule?_ Because not eveything in the resource pack is something that Hive may use, which will make the repo a mess, should Hive end up using one of the things in the resource pack I will copy it to Hive's repo. On the subject of Hive and resorce packs, I keep Hive in a resorce pack, but this may change once I need to run Howl.
