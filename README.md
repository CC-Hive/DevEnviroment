# This is Lupus590's Minecraft Instance
When testing Hive, this is what environment I will be using, if you are having issues then you may want to use this.

Other developers are encouraged to try variations and different environments, Hive needs to be adaptable. Remember to report your bugs.
If you want to track your environment then create a branch and make your changes there. For ease of identifying which branch is who's, please name your branch after yourself.

Note: This is technical a mod pack, follow the licenses of the mods your are using.

Note: I have programming stuff in my resource pack folder (which is on the gitignore list), if code is broken because it's using something external then this is why. Please [yell at me](https://github.com/CC-Hive/DevEnviroment/issues/new). FYI, that resource pack is available [here](https://github.com/lupus590/CC-My-Code-Pack). _Why not use a submodule?_ Because not everything in the resource pack is something that Hive may use, which will make the repo a mess, should Hive end up using one of the things in the resource pack I will copy it to Hive's repo. On the subject of Hive and resource packs, I keep Hive in a resource pack, but this may change once I need to run Howl.
