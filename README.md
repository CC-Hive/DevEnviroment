# This is Lupus590's Minecraft Instance
When testing Hive, this is what enviroment I will be using, if you are having issues then you may want to use this.

Other developers are encuraged to try variations and different enviroments, Hive needs to be adapatble. Remember to report your bugs.
If you want to track your enviromemt then create a branch and make your changes there. For ease of identifying which branch who's, please name the branch after yourself.

Note: I have programming stuff in my resource pack folder (which is on the gitignore list), if code is broken because it's using something exernal then this is why. Please yell at me. FYI, it's available [here](https://github.com/lupus590/CC-My-Code-Pack). _Why not use a submodule?_ Because not eveything in the resource pack is something that Hive may use, which will make the repo a mess, should Hive end up using one of the things in the resource pack I will copy it to Hive's repo.
