Note: I have programming stuff in my resource pack folder (which is on the gitignore list), if code is broken because it's using something exernal then this is why. Please yell at me. FYI, the it's available [here](https://github.com/lupus590/CC-My-Code-Pack). _Why not use a submodule?_ Because not eveything in the resource pack is something that Hive may use, which will make the repo a mess, should Hive end up using one of the things in the resource pack I will copy it to Hive's repo.
